# Write-Output("Hello World")

I'm a Azure Cloud Engineer with a passion for automating the boring stuff using PowerShell. This blog will be my spot to talk about the latest projects I've completed and I hope the knowledge shared can benefit you too.

Outside of working as a Cloud Engineer I enjoy playing Guitar and Piano and spending time with family and friends playing board games or video games!
